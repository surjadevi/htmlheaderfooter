# Overview
In this project, I have created a header and footer using Html 5 and CSS. I have used the icons from Font awesome.
I created the header and footer without using boostrap and only using pure css.
In the header , I have also used the submenus to show different categories. I created this separate header and footer so that I can used as component in other part of the pages.

## Code Overview
I have used ul and li tags to design the header menus as well as sub menus and added css to it.
For footer also, I have used the same. You can have a look in the code folder.

## Further improvement
I have to update css for responsiveness for different devices.
